# javascript-api-test
Test for Front end developer candidates. When you start the test, create a branch off of master that you will name after you and when you are done create a pull request assigned to Clara Grant or James Baker. Good luck!

# Story
The quarterly review of the company is upon us and we need to find beers for everyone! There's 30 people expected to go and we want a good variety of beers but also a good amount of pale ales. 

# The test
Using the Punk API create a single page application where people can search beers by name or description and display all the beers with their names, images and taglines. The single page application should allow the user to add a beer they like to a general basket where all the employee of the company can see/add to. There will be a limit of 10 different types of beers and a total limit of 60 beers overall in the basket. You have a 2 hour limit to do this test. We don't expect you to finish (although if you do then thats good too) we just want to test your way of thinking and how you go about solving this problem.

# The tools
You can use any tools you are comfortable with to code this application (ReactJS, Vue, Angular...) and you must use the Punk API (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to get the data from. The API has a request limit of 3600 per hour, so you may want to save the json response to work with during the test. You are welcome to add any documentation to your code especially commands for us to test it.
